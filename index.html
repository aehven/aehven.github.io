  Binary Trees is a one-man (me, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-ehven/" target="_blank">Adam Ehven</a>) software development company in Golden, Colorado.
I freelance for a number of companies and am always looking for more work.  I've done all sorts of
things over the years, from FORTRAN in the aerospace industry to C++ in the telephony industry,
to Ruby on Rails in web development -- which is my current focus and what most people need nowadays.
</p>

<p>
  If your business needs custom software, I can build it for you.  We can talk about what you need,
come up with a plan we can all get behind, and I'll go build it for you.  I'll also take care of Web
deployment and maintenance, so you don't have to worry about operational headaches.
</p>

<p>
  I use common, open-source tools to build the application, so the only cost to you is
labor and web hosting services.  You will have complete access to the source code and
the web server -- it's all <em>your</em> stuff, I just take care of it for you.
Take this stuff to any other developer at any time, and they'll know what to do with it.
