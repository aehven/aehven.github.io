  Binary Trees is a one-man (me, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-ehven/" target="_blank">Adam Ehven</a>) software development company in Golden, Colorado.
I freelance for a number of companies and am always looking for more work.  I've done all sorts of
things over the years, from FORTRAN in the aerospace industry to C++ in the telephony industry,
to Ruby on Rails in web development -- which is my current focus and what most people need nowadays.
</p>

<p>
  If your business needs custom software, I can build it for you.  We can talk about what you need,
come up with a plan we can all get behind, and I'll go build it for you.  I'll also take care of Web
deployment and maintenance, so you don't have to worry about operational headaches.
</p>

<p>
  I use common, open-source tools to build the application, so the only cost to you is
labor and web hosting services.  You will have complete access to the source code and
the web server -- it's all <em>your</em> stuff, I just take care of it for you.
Take this stuff to any other developer at any time, and they'll know what to do with it.

  You can see some of my work on <a href="http://github.com/aehven" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, although much of it is in private repositories there.

  A sample application that does a few basic things that most applications do is at <a href="http://iflc.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">IFLC</a>.
This application, while affirming my love for many things that begin with the letter C (chocolate, cake, cervesa!) serves well
as a starting point for many applications.  I can use this to hit the ground running on many different kinds of projects.  It shows basic navigation, user management,
domain model, forms, and front- and back-end integration using a RESTful API.  It's built using Ruby on Rails in the back end and Angular in the front.  It runs
on Heroku.
</p>

<p>
  To the extent that the basics of <a href="http://iflc.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">IFLC</a> are much like the basics of any other app, you get this code for free.

<p>
  As most of the web development I've done is on sites that require loggin in, here are some screen shots that might give you some idea of what's out there.
