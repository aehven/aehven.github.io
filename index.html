  Binary Trees is a one-man (me, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-ehven/" target="_blank">Adam Ehven</a>) software development company in Golden, Colorado.
I freelance for a number of companies and am always interested in new projects.  I've done all sorts of
things over the years, from FORTRAN in the aerospace industry to C++ and Java in the telephony industry,
to Ruby on Rails in web development -- which is my current focus and what most people need nowadays.
</p>

<p>
  If your business needs custom software, look no further.  Together, we'll figure out exactly what you need and I'll go build it for you.
We'll be in constant communication throughout the design and development process and you can fine-tune your requirements as often
as you like, so you'll be sure to have what you wanted in the end.
I'll also take care of Web deployment and maintenance, so you don't have to worry about operational headaches.
</p>

<p>
  I use common open-source tools to build the application, so the only cost to you is
labor and web hosting services (which are usually pretty cheap).  You will have complete access to the source code and
the web server -- it's all <em>your</em> stuff, I just take care of it for you.
Take this stuff to any other developer at any time, and they'll know what to do with it.

  My latest project is a fantasy soccer application with a unique twist on how you value
  players and earn points.  You can see it at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.footballneversleeps.co.uk">here</a>,
  and even play it in demo mode.

  You can see some of my work on <a href="http://github.com/aehven" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, although much of it is in private repositories there.

  A sample application that does a few basic things that most applications do is at <a href="http://iflc.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">IFLC</a>.
While affirming my love for many things that begin with the letter C (chocolate, cake, cerveza!), this application serves well
as a starting point for many applications.  I can use this to hit the ground running on many different kinds of projects.  It shows basic navigation, user management,
domain model, forms, and front- and back-end integration using a RESTful API.  It's built using Ruby on Rails in the back end and Angular in the front.  It runs
on Heroku.
</p>

<p>
  To the extent that the basics of <a href="http://iflc.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">IFLC</a> are much like the basics of any other app, you get this much code for free.

  As most of the web development I've done is on sites that require logging in, here are some screen shots that might give you some idea of what's out there.
</p>

<p class="caption">
  The application below configures programmable lockboxes.  It handles a large number of customers, each of which has
any number of lockboxes which they can program to respond to different kinds of PINs at various times.  This application uses
Ruby on Rails and Angular JS.
</p>

<p class="caption">
  Next is a fully RoR application (Rails-generated views as well) that controls a magnetic therapy device, as well as all the back-office
issues of customer and user setup, treatment protocol definition, credit card payments, etc. etc.
</p>

<p class="caption">
  A couple of shots now of an application that controls variable message signs such as the ones you see on the road around construction sites and events.
Along with controlling the signs' displays, this application can also graph telemetry from the signs, show where they are on the map, and even
send alarms when they "leave" a geographical area they're supposed to stay in....

  And here's an old-school Java desktop application, the kind you have to install on your PC or Mac.  It's
the early version of the lockbox application shown above.  If you have legacy software that gets installed like in the old days
and you want to move it to the web -- I've done that, too.
